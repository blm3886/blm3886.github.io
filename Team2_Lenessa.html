								<blockquote><b>Sometimes, one can just come up with an idea by holding onto an adjective.</h4>
								It was one of the best guiding video that I and my team have come
across. Ramesh Sir’s remarks triggered new ideas that would be
beneficial for our future generations. He spoke about how the digital
technologies are impacting the physical world and leading to different
conditions. New technologies and the digitalized people which are
coming on board are creating billion dollar opportunities. We should
think and move linearly and not leniently, with this he associated various
examples. MIT Media Lab is working on various projects and in India
they have club that holds the same known as “Redx Club”.</b></blockquote>

							<h3>FIELD VISIT TO
							DAILY DUMP, AIROLI
							By Keerthi R and Selva Kumar Konar</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="content"><center>
						<span><img src="images/067.jpg" width="75%"></span></center>
						<p><b>20th June 2019 1.00 PM</br>
						As a part of the project on ‘Segregation of Waste using AI’ a field visit was conducted to Daily Dump Organisation in Airoli, Navi Mumbai
						Mr. Prem Bhatia at Daily Dump gave his  valuable time to discuss the project and also answer the survey questions.
						He also shared his organisation’s activities on the various methods of waste management.
						</p>
						<p><h1>Based on the interaction we concluded the following points</h1></p>
						<ol>
						<li>The project idea would be functional on a large scale (e.g at municipality level).</li>
						<li>The prime focus should be laid on segregation of waste at source i.e. household.</li>
						<li>More than 80% of waste is organic and hence can be segregated and made useful at source.</li>
						<li>There is a widespread acceptance to such ideas in the society as long as it is feasible and easy to handle.</li>
						<li>The current system for segregation is inefficient.</li>
						<li>Segregation of waste is an urban problem that requires multiple solutions.</li>
						<li>Lack of awareness in society is a major issue.</li>

					<h3>FIELD VISIT TO
					Evergreen Recycle karo, Rabale, NaviMumbai.
					By Lenessa Colacco and Venessa Colacco</h3>
					<center>
					<span><img src="images/072.jpg" width="75%"></span></center>
					<p><b>28 th June 2019 11:00 AM</br>
						Regarding the project -Segregation of solid waste using AI a survey was conducted via call
with Mr. Rajesh Gupta member of an NGO Evergreen Recycle karo who work in the field of
waste management. The conversation was around 15 minutes long where gave his precious time
to guide us and also suggest some ideas for our project.</br>
He first gave an introduction about his NGO and the tasks they have undertaken regarding waste
management and how they work as an NGO.
<ol>
<li> Concerning waste he stated that “There is nothing called as waste if one knows how to
make an efficient resource out of that material”.</li>
<li> We discussed about the current waste management conditions in India and how efficient
it is and whether it’s useful or not to segregate the waste collected and how the
segregated waste can be used.</li>
</ol>
He mainly emphasized on segregating the waste on smaller scales as it would be easier, simpler
and also more efficient.</li>
Talking about the project he said that
<ol>
<li>The idea widely accepted but will be facing certain hurdles as it needs to be applied on a
large scale and will be needing a lot of capital and maintenance.</li>
<li> But it will be quite beneficial even if we are able to turn 30% of the produced waste into
a resource.</li>
<li>According to him the ineffectiveness of the current systems is mainly due to public
ignorance about waste separation. So if someone comes up with automatic waste
separation method then it will be widely accepted and well appreciated.</li></ol>

					<h3>FIELD VISIT TO
						ANTONY WASTE HANDLING CELL LIMITED
				By Venessa Colaco</h3>

				<span><img src="images/073.jpg" width="75%"></span></center>
				<p><b>June 28, 2019 5:00 pm</br>
					During the fourth week of the project regarding segregation of waste using Artificial Intelligence
various survey were conducted regarding the concern of the project. For the same a survey was
conducted by via call with the social manager Mr. Aniket Jhadav of an NGO ‘Antony waste
handling cell limited’ involved in sewage and waste disposal and sanitation.</br>
The first part of the conversation was related to the NGO, after which he asked the reason for the
project and the basic idea of the project. In later part of the conversation few points were
discussed regarding the establishment, necessity and functioning of the project.
Discussion and conclusion of the survey:
<ol>
<li>The main reason for lack of segregation is people’s ignorance and lack of awareness.</li>
<li> The current method of waste segregation is in sufficient.</li>
<li>Main focus must be done on organic waste segregation as it produces a good compost
matter.</li>
<li> Recyclable waste must be segregated only if it is economically favorable.</li>
<li>It is necessary to segregate waste at household level. Later segregation becomes more
difficult with the increasing levels..</li>
<li>Certain changes must be made in the project to make it economically more acceptable.</li></ol>

				<h3>FIELD VISIT TO
					Earth5R
			By Selvakumar</h3>
			<center>
			<span><img src="images/066.jpg" width="75%"></span></center>
			<p><b>June 28, 2019 </br>
				An interactive session was conducted with the representative of the Earth5R
	Organization during which we had a discussion on the topic of “segregation of
	waste using artificial intelligence”.
	The first part of the discussion focused on the various sustainable development
	program and initiatives that they undertake and perform while the latter half
	revolved around the idea of using artificial intelligence for waste management.
	Key points of the survey:-
<ol>
<li>It is of the paramount importance that the segregation of waste is to be
implemented more on the household level.</li>
<li>There is a need of citizen’s involvement in sustainable development against
the increasing environmental risks.</li>
<li>There is a lack of awareness regarding waste management and the process of
recycling which makes the process a lot less effective.</li>
<li> The implementation of our project will be more feasible on a large scale.</li>
<li>The people should undertake and practice various methods and processes of
recycling and waste segregation which is more suitable to the locality in
which they live in.</li>
</ol>
