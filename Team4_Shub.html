								<blockquote><b>Change cannot be seen and achieved in one single day it needs proper planning and execution , Ramesh Raskar sir introduced us to such a great , efficient and accurate idea of planning and execution of our new ideas i.e the spot-probe method of 10weeks it was like a highway for our new ideas. The way he showed us the power of technology was really great and we could find out 1000's of opportunities in it and can change the lives. Right from going cashless to portable medical devices technology and digitalization has changed the world and a new era of automation has begun. The most amazing point for me and my team was the cycle of excitement , boring and comfort zone it clearly explains how our new ideas can get a thrust and track for its application. Every single day world needs modification and updation this is only possible through research and application of new idea and in turn the process has many opportunities hidden in it.</b></blockquote>

									<dt>BREAKTHROUGHS AND RISKS</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>The temples owned by government bodies or parties are reluctant to share
information about the trustees and any vendors.According to locals, there are no regular flower vendors. They may come or may
not. So the flowers are brought by the locals visiting the temples.Temples owned by big organizations provide the flowers but are reluctant to
share the source.Some temples own their personal garden but access to it is not allowed.The temple attendants get offended when asked about the flower source.
Few temples lie on the outskirts of the city so the access gets difficult.</p>

						<p>We got to interact with many people and got the real image of
situation , all these interactions were very helpful and gave us
the clear idea of future of our project and also provided us
track to work further on our project</p>
						<p><h1>Based on the interaction we concluded the following points</h1></p>
						<ol>
						<li> the concept and our idea of organic dye has great scope and
is very much needed in textile and dye industry</li>
						<li> the textile and dye industries are facing a lot of problems by
government and pollution control board.</li>
						<li>there is no proper method for disposal of floral waste. </li>
						<li>almost 80% of temples are discarding their floral waste in
rivers or in municipal waste there by polluting river and giving
rise to land pollution</li>
						<li> 5% of temples give their floral offerings back to devotees
after touching flower to god</li>
						<li>5% of temples give the offering back to flower vendors and
reuse it again there by reducing the floral waste generation. </li>
						<li>10% of temples make fertilizer from their floral waste or
make compost from it and use it as manure in their own fields
and farms.</li>
