								<h2>WEEK 4</h2></h2>
							<h3>FIELD VISIT TO
							DAILY DUMP, AIROLI
							By Keerthi R and Selva Kumar Konar</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="content"><center>

						<p><b>20th June 2019 1.00 PM</br>
						As a part of the project on ‘Segregation of Waste using AI’ a field visit was conducted to Daily Dump Organisation in Airoli, Navi Mumbai
						Mr. Prem Bhatia at Daily Dump gave his  valuable time to discuss the project and also answer the survey questions.
						He also shared his organisation’s activities on the various methods of waste management.
						</p>
						<p><h1>Based on the interaction we concluded the following points</h1></p>
						<ol>
						<li>The project idea would be functional on a large scale (e.g at municipality level).</li>
						<li>The prime focus should be laid on segregation of waste at source i.e. household.</li>
						<li>More than 80% of waste is organic and hence can be segregated and made useful at source.</li>
						<li>There is a widespread acceptance to such ideas in the society as long as it is feasible and easy to handle.</li>
						<li>The current system for segregation is inefficient.</li>
						<li>Segregation of waste is an urban problem that requires multiple solutions.</li>
						<li>Lack of awareness in society is a major issue.</li>
